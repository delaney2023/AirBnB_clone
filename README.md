DESCRIPTION
AirBnB is a complete web application, that integrates database storage, a back-end API, and a front-end interface.

This project is composed of A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

Starting the Commandline Interpreter  we use the following command

$ ./console.py

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
